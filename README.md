### Description
This is the second project proposed in the Udacity's [**Programing for Data Science with Python**][nanodegreelink] Nanodegree Program.

It is built using [`Python`][Pythonlink] and tells us about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. It provides the following informations.

1. **Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

  - most common month
  - most common day of week
  - most common hour of day


2. **Stations and trip**

  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent ombination of start station and end station)


3. **Trip duration**

  - total travel time
  - average travel time


4. **User info**

  - counts of each user type
  - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### Requirements
- [`Python 3.x`][Pythonlink], with [`Numpy`][numpylink] and [`Pandas`][pandaslink] installed
- CSV data files for Chicago, New York City, and Washington


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### Usage
1. Donwload the files below and place them in the same **specific directory** on your local machine.

  - `Bikeshare.py` : the main python project file from the repository
  - CSV data files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv` and `washington.csv` ) from this [`location`][csvlink]


2. Open your favorite terminal to this **specific directory** and type the following command

  ```
